# theVault Lite

This is a lightweight, unbloated, scalable and expandable unblocked game site.

Its simplicty in both the website and the code allows low-end devices, like school computers, to play, but also great expansion for developers to add their own features to this or use this as a building block for a new project -- please be aware though to follow the license attributed. 

theVault lite utilizes self-hosting to minimize as much traffic to outside sites as possible, loading games faster than traditional UBGs. The site also uses no external libraries or frameworks, for an overall speedy experience.

### Deployment 

Buttons will be added soon. For now, you can clone the repository to any platform. If you don't know how, refer to their docs for deploying static repositories.
