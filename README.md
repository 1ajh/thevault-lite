# theVault Lite

theVault Lite is a lightweight, unbloated, scalable, and expandable unblocked game site.

Its simplicty in both the website and the code allows low-end devices, like school computers, to play, but also great expansion for developers to add their own features to this or use this as a building block for a new project -- please be aware though to follow the license attributed. 

theVault lite utilizes self-hosting to minimize as much traffic to outside sites as possible, loading games faster than traditional UBGs. The site also uses no external libraries or frameworks, for an overall speedy experience.

There is lots of flexibility for developers who would like to expand this project, and ordinary users who would like to deploy.
